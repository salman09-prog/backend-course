# Backend Course — JavaScript Foundations to Advanced Node.js

This repository contains my complete backend development journey — from JavaScript fundamentals to advanced Node.js, Express, databases, authentication, Docker, system design, and deployment.

Every day of learning is organised into its own folder, with clean code, tasks, assignments, and notes.
