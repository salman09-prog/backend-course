# Day 2 — Primitives, Objects, Arrays, Type Conversion

### Concepts I learned
- Primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol)
- Objects and Arrays (non-primitives)
- Soft copy vs Hard copy (reference vs memory copy)
- Array methods (push, pop, concat, includes)
- Type coercion (implicit vs explicit)

### Notes
- Never rely on implicit type conversion
- Always use spread operator for hard copies
- `typeof NaN` is `"number"` because it's a failed numeric computation
