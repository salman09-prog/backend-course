SECTION A — Concepts (5 questions)

Q1). Explain exactly why this prints "object" even though it clearly fails?
-> It will not print "object", it will print "number". and why number? bcoz it is the output which
we got from a numeric process or we can say it is the result of a numeric operation. We get NaN when
the numerical operation fails

Q.2) Why is this dangerous? 
let x = "5";
let y = 10;
console.log(x + y);

ANS = Because we are trying to add a number and a string value, and in such cases, JS assumes by default
that maybe a user wants to concat this string, so if either of the operand is a string, JS consider it as 
a concatination not addition. Doing this can result in unexpected outcomes and bugs

Q.3) Tell me the difference between soft copy vs hard copy in one single sentence each.
ANS = in Soft copies, when we change the element in any one of the array, it will reflect in the copy or in the og array.
Whereas in hard copies, both the arrays are independent, changes doesnt reflect.


SECTION B — Write code (5 tasks) :- 

Task 1 — HARD COPY

Make a hard copy of this array:-

ANS = const nums = [1,2,3]
const hardCopy = [...nums]
console.log(hardCopy);


Task 2 — REMOVE last item of array

Remove the last item of:-

ANS = let arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
let lastItem = arr.pop();
console.log(lastItem);

Task 3 — Check empty array

Write an if condition that prints "empty" if array is empty, else "not empty". :- 

ANS = let newArr = [];

if (newArr.length == 0) {
  console.log("Array is empty");
} else {
  console.log("Array not is empty");
}

Task 4 — Check username uniqueness

Given :-

ANS = const u1 = "salman09";
const u2 = "salman09";

if(u1 === u2){
    console.log("Duplicate");
} else {
    console.log("OK");
}


Task 5 — Merging

Merge these two arrays properly :-

ANS = 
let a = ["tokyo", "rome"];
let b = ["delhi", "paris"];

let c = [...a, ...b]
console.log(c);


SECTION C — Edge case brain test (2 tricky ones)

Q4). What will this print? And why?
console.log(1 + true);

ANS = this will print 2. JS will do implicit conversion of true -> 1. Since the numerical representation of
true is 1, so that is why we get 1 by converting true. Then 1 + 1 = 2.


Q5). Predict output:-

let arr = [];
let copy = arr;
copy.push(10);
console.log(arr.length);

ANS = output will be 1. Because we created soft copy here which allows modifications in both the arrays even if we made changes in any one array.
